# Trevis Calculator
This is a code to solve a problem that people who sell in a store ask me to solve, because they want to get a faster calculation day by day.
## Technological tools used in this project.
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. SASS
4. JAVASCRIPT
## Code documentation
  At first, I established the next tasks to follow in the process:
### 1: I made the logic with JavaScript.
  Here, I put the formulas (like the way to calculate a percentage), I also used structures like the **switch** to obtain a specific value in order to the offer entered by the user. Or the conditional **if** to find a word to describe the status of an operation. Further, I made the **logic** to validate the input that the user enters, a logic to know if a number is   negative, positive, decimal, and how to operate in each of these situations.
### 2: I connected HTML with JavaScript.
  At this point, I used the **ids** of some inputs to obtain user values, with the objective to use them in **JavaScript** logic. Further, I called the functions in JavaScript using the event 'on input' in HTML. This event allows users to get their results at the moment that they enter a value in the input.

### 3: I created a structure to the page using HTML.
  The HTML structure is made with **semantic writing**, I also used **BEM methodology.**

### 4: I created the styles using SASS.
  There, I created placeholders and variables to **reused parts of the code.**
