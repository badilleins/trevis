## Code documentation
  ------
  At first, I stablished the next tasks to follow in the process:
###  1: I made the logic with JavaScript
  -----
Here, I put the formulas (like the way to calculate a percentage), I also used structures like switch to obtain a specific value in order to the offer entered by the user. Or the conditional if to find a word to describe the status of an operation. Further, I made the logic to validate the input that the user enter.
-------
###  2: I connected HTML with JavaScript
------
  At this point, I used the ids of some inputs to obtain user values, with the objective to user them in the JavaScript logic. Further, I called the functions in JavaScript using the event 'oninput' in HTML. This event allows users to get their results at the same moment that they enter a value in the input.
-------
### 3: I created a structure to the page using HTML
---------
The HTML structure is made with a semantic writing, I also used BEM methodology.
--------
### 4: I created the styles using SASS
--------
There, I created placeholders and variables to reused parts of the code.
